# Searching Algorithms in C++

This repository contains fundamental searching algorithm implementations 
developed in C++ as part of my Software Engineering studies.

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Sequential search through the array
- Works on both sorted and unsorted arrays

### 2. Binary Search (Iterative)
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Requires sorted array
- Efficient divide-and-conquer strategy

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Time complexity analysis (Big-O notation)
- Iterative algorithm design
- Efficient search strategies
- Problem-solving with arrays
